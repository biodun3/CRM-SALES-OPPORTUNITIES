<b>From the CRM+SALES+OPPORTUNITY data above i displayed visually the following: </b>
         <br/>
      1) Account with more than or equal to 30 lost opportunity for some sort of compensation </b>
      <br/>
      2) Total close_value of each account. To know the highest earner and the lowest earner </b>
       <br/>
      3) The most successful sales agent under each account i.e sales agent with the highest won opportunity </b>
      <br/>
      4) Total opportunity won, lost, still engaging and prospecting under each account </b>
      <br/>
      5) Region with the most won opportunity, to know the most successful of the regions </b>
      <br/>
      <br/>
    I joined all data needed to solve these problems from all the data files together. Then sorted and filtered it </b>
    <br/>
    - and also created an extra column "duration(days)" to know how long it took to finalize each Opportunity </b>
